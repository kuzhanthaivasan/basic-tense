        <h1>Perfect Tenses in Grammar</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
    </center>
        <p>In English grammar, perfect tenses are used to describe actions or events that are completed, finished, or have a specific relationship to another point in time. There are three primary perfect tenses:</p>

    <div class="box1">
    <center>
        <h2>1. Present Perfect Tense</h2>
        <hr>
    </center>
        <p>The present perfect tense is used to describe actions or events that happened at an unspecified time in the past and have relevance to the present. It is formed by using the present tense of the verb "to have" (have or has) and the past participle form of the main verb (e.g., "I have seen that movie before").</p>
    <br><br><br>
        <center><h2>2. Past Perfect Tense</h2>
            <hr>
        </center>

        <p>The past perfect tense is used to describe actions or events that were completed before another past action or point in time. It is formed by using the past tense of the verb "to have" (had) and the past participle form of the main verb (e.g., "She had already finished her work when I arrived").</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <center>
        <h2>3. Future Perfect Tense</h2>
        <hr>
    </center>

        <p>The future perfect tense is used to describe actions or events that will be completed before a specific point in the future. It is formed by using the future tense of the verb "to have" (will have) and the past participle form of the main verb (e.g., "By tomorrow, I will have completed my assignment").</p>
    <br><br><br>
        <p>Perfect tenses are valuable in English because they allow speakers and writers to express the idea of completion, continuity, or a relationship between different points in time, providing a more nuanced context in sentences.</p>
