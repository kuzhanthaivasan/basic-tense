        <h1>Verb Tenses</h1>
    </center>
    <hr>
        <p>Verb tenses are an essential aspect of grammar in the English language. They indicate the timing of an action or event and help convey when something happened. There are three primary verb tenses in English: past, present, and future.</p>
    
        <p>In grammar, verb tenses are essential for indicating the timing of actions or events in relation to the present, past, or future. There are three primary verb tenses in English:</p>

    <h2>1. Present Tense</h2>
</center>
    <p>The present tense is used to describe actions, events, or conditions that are happening right now or are generally true. In this tense, verbs often take the base form, with or without an "s" in the third person singular (e.g., "he walks").</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <center>
    <h2>2. Past Tense</h2>
</center>
    <p>The past tense is used to describe actions, events, or conditions that have already occurred in the past. Regular verbs typically add "-ed" to the base form (e.g., "talked"), while irregular verbs have specific past tense forms (e.g., "went").</p>
<br>
<br>
<center>
    <h2>3. Future Tense</h2>
</center>
    <p>The future tense is used to describe actions, events, or conditions that will happen at some point in the future. It is commonly formed by using auxiliary verbs like "will" or "shall" followed by the base form of the verb (e.g., "I will eat").</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

    <p>Understanding verb tenses is fundamental in grammar, as they help convey the timing of actions and events accurately in sentences.</p>
