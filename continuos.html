        <h1>Continuous Tenses in Grammar</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
        <p>In English grammar, continuous tenses, also known as progressive tenses, are used to describe actions or situations that are ongoing, in progress, or happening at a specific moment in time. There are three primary continuous tenses:</p>

<div class="box1">
    <center>
        <h2>1. Present Continuous Tense</h2>
        </center>
        <p>The present continuous tense is used to describe actions or events that are happening right now, at the present moment, or are planned for the future. It is formed by using the present tense of the verb "to be" (am, is, are) and adding the base form of the main verb with the "-ing" ending (e.g., "I am eating lunch now").</p>
    <br>
    <br><br>
    <center>
        <h2>2. Past Continuous Tense</h2>
    </center>
        <p>The past continuous tense is used to describe actions or events that were ongoing in the past at a specific moment or during a particular period. It is formed by using the past tense of the verb "to be" (was, were) and adding the base form of the main verb with the "-ing" ending (e.g., "She was reading a book when the phone rang").</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <center>
        <h2>3. Future Continuous Tense</h2>
    </center>
        <p>The future continuous tense is used to describe actions or events that will be in progress at a specific point in the future. It is formed by using the future tense of the verb "to be" (will be) and adding the base form of the main verb with the "-ing" ending (e.g., "They will be working late tomorrow").</p>
    <br><br><br>
        <p>Continuous tenses are important in English because they allow speakers and writers to convey the duration, continuity, and ongoing nature of actions or situations, providing a more detailed context in sentences.</p>
