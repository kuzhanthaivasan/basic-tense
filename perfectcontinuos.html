        <h1>Perfect Continuous Tense in Grammar</h1>
        <hr>
    </center>
        <p>In English grammar, the perfect continuous tense, also known as the perfect progressive tense, is used to describe actions or situations that started in the past, have been ongoing, and are relevant to the present or to a specific point in time. There are two primary perfect continuous tenses:</p>

        <h2>1. Present Perfect Continuous Tense</h2>
    </center>
    
        <p>The present perfect continuous tense is used to describe actions or situations that started in the past and have continued up to the present moment or have just recently stopped. It emphasizes the duration and continuity of the action. This tense is formed by using the present tense of the verb "to have" (have or has), the word "been," and the base form of the main verb with the "-ing" ending (e.g., "I have been studying for two hours").</p>
    <br><br>
    <br>
    <center>
        <h2>2. Past Perfect Continuous Tense</h2>
    </center>

        <p>The past perfect continuous tense is used to describe actions or situations that were ongoing in the past for a specified duration and were completed before another past action or point in time. It emphasizes both the duration and the completion of the action. This tense is formed by using the past tense of the verb "to have" (had), the word "been," and the base form of the main verb with the "-ing" ending (e.g., "She had been working all night before she got some rest").</p>
    <br><br><br>
       
        <center>
        <h1>Future Perfect Continuous Tense in Grammar</h1>
    </center>
        <p>In English grammar, the future perfect continuous tense is used to describe actions or situations that will have been ongoing for a certain duration before a specific point in the future. This tense combines elements of both duration and completion. It is formed by using the future perfect tense of the verb "to have" (will have), the word "been," and the base form of the main verb with the "-ing" ending (e.g., "By this time next year, I will have been working here for ten years").</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The perfect continuous tenses allow speakers and writers to convey the idea of an action or situation that has been in progress and has a connection to the present or another point in the past. It adds a layer of detail and context to sentences.</p>
